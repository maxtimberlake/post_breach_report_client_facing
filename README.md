<h1>Proof Of Concept of Post-Breach Report</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves creating a formal report aimed at communicating the key details to a client who may not have a technical background. The report is designed to serve as a quick reference guide for a senior analyst rather than a document to be read verbatim. I've extracted and reformatted the relevant information from the original document into a Word file to ensure the confidentiality of the company's internal policies and templates.
